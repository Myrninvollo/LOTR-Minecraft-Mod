Hroom, hroom. What have we here?
Welcome to the forest, young master #.
Leave the trees alone, and the trees will leave you alone!
It is rare to see one of your kind come this deep into the forest.
You little ones all seem so hasty. Coming and going and coming and going...
We Ents would have trouble keeping up with such a pace as yours.
Hroom, hroom.
We Ents rarely say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
I have been feeling rather tree-ish lately.
Do you ever feel the need to find a nice grove and stand there for a while? A little sleep would do me good, I think.
The pace of life among your kind seems terribly hasty, young #.
Can you hear the trees, #? Some of them have voices here.
Tree? I am no tree, young master #. I am an Ent!
I haven't seen anything like you in quite a while, little one.
I have walked beneath the sun for ages beyond memory, and still I find that every day brings new wonders.
Slow down, #! There is no need to do everything so hastily.
Hroom, hroom, hroom. Where are you going, little one?
Nobody cares for the trees and the forests anymore.
Too often, you little ones have brought only ruin to our forests.
The rain and river-water taste good here, #.
Have you any news of the Entwives?
There are trees in this forest that have woken up. Some even have voices of their own.
