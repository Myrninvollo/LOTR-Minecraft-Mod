And what do you think you're up to, #?
Troublemaker! We don't tolerate you in these parts!
Get out of the Shire, #!
Get out of the Shire!
I'll be reporting you to my old Gaffer!
Stay away from the Shire!
You're pushing your luck, coming into these parts.
So you're one of these troublemakers I've been hearing about. Stay away, #!
Uncouth folk like you aren't welcome here, #!
Just what do you think you're doing coming into the Shire, #?
By the feather in my hat, I'll put a stop to your mischief!
