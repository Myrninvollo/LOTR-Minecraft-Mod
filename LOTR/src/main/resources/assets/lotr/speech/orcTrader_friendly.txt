Orcs like silver coins as much as the next race, you know...
Bring me coins if you want equipment.
So you have proven yourself, #. Now we can trade.
A nice little stinking sum of silver coins might be nice.
If you want to trade, bring some coins, and keep it quiet.
An orc can never have enough silver coins, maggot!
I might be interested in buying some materials.
Certain materials can fetch a good price among traders like myself.
I love crunching on a nice elf bone!
