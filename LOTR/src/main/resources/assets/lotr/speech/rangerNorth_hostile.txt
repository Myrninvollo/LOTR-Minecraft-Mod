Your death shall come swift as the arrow that pierces flesh, #!
I shall make an end of you!
You are not welcome in these lands, #!
Flee our lands, you wretched ally of the Morgul-filth!
You are an enemy of the race of men, #!
What madness led you here?
Crawl back into the night, #!
You thought you could match our skill? You are sorely mistaken!
When did # forsake reason for madness?
Your doom approaches, #!
Do not underestimate the Rangers of the North.
