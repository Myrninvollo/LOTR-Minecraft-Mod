I defend this woodland realm from those who would seek its destruction.
There is powerful magic here.
Beware, #... there is much evil afoot in these lands.
I fight for the Silvan elves of Mirkwood.
It is not often that men venture into Mirkwood from outside.
Stay out of the shadows, #.
Much evil lurks beyond our borders.
A star shines upon our meeting, elf-friend.
Welcome to the land of the Elvenking, #.
Welcome to our woodland realm.
Beware the spawn of Ungoliant!
We elves of the Woodland Realm must remain vigilant, for there is always evil on our borders.
Always we must be on the watch, #.
