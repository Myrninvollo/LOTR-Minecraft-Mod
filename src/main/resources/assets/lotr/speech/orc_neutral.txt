I smell man-flesh!
I've had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
What are you after, maggot?
Follow your orders, scum!
You don't look like a goblin-man!
Do you want something?
Don't just stand there! Do something!
I don't trust you, maggot!
Whom do you serve?
Move along, scum!
Are you trying to start a fight?
You stink!
