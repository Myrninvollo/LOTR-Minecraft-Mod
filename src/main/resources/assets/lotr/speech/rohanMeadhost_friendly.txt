Welcome! Welcome to my hall, #!
Welcome to @, #! What can I do for you today?
This is @. As fine a place to lose your wits as any in Rohan.
Getting a tingling feeling, #? If not, you haven't drunk enough!
The finest mead in all of Rohan for just a few silver coins!
We men of Rohan love a good tankard of mead.
What can I do for you, #?
Ho! Ho! Ho! To the bottle I go. To heal my heart and drown my woe!
Hungry? Thirsty? How can I help you today, #?
You look like you need a good mug of mead!
Here in the hall of @ we shall feast like kings.
It is a fine day for a drink!
Come in and make yourself at home, weary traveller.
Good day, #.
Freshly brewed mead and a hearty meal for only a few coins!
