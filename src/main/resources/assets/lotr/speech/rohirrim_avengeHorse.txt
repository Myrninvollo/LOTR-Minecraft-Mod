We do not suffer the life of those who put horses to death!
Your actions have earned you a fearsome foe, #!
Do not think you can treat the steeds of Rohan with such cruelty!
What devilry comes hence? A murderer of horses? Let us put them to death!
No friend of Rohan would commit such a crime!
Truly you are a foe of the Rohirrim, #!
Flee these lands, #, enemy of the horses of Rohan!
Do not think such wickedness can pass unnoticed here, #!
You slew a horse of Rohan? Your life shall be forfeit!
