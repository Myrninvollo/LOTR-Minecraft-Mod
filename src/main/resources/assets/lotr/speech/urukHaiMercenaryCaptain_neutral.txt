You think I'd sell mercenaries to scum like you? Ha!
Only the foulest of men can command Uruk-hai, #.
Work some more evil, and then perhaps I'll consider trading units with you.
Come back when you've proven your worth, maggot.
I'm not selling any Uruk-hai to you until you kill some more filthy enemies!
You can barely even ride a Warg, so why should I let you hire any stinking goblin-men?
Filth like you wanting to hire Uruk-hai? What's the next trick?
